# Compliance Mapping

This folder contains documentation that maps Emyzer Technology's information security policies to their organizational benefits and required compliance evidence.

**What is compliance mapping?** Compliance mapping connects an organization's internal policies to external standards and regulations. It answers three questions: What rules must we follow? How do our policies address those rules? What proof do we have?
