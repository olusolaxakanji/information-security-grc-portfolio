## Framework Alignment

- **NIST SP 800-30** – Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
- **NIST SP 800-37** – Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- **ISO/IEC 27005** – Information Security Risk Management

## Risk Assessment Process

1. **Context Establishment** – Define scope, boundaries, and risk criteria
2. **Risk Identification** – Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
3. **Risk Analysis** – Determine likelihood and impact using qualitative/quantitative methods
4. **Risk Evaluation** – Compare against risk appetite and prioritize treatment
5. **Risk Treatment** – Select and implement appropriate controls
6. **Monitoring & Review** – Continuous reassessment and reporting

## Integration with GRC Policies

Risk assessments directly inform the following policies within this portfolio:

- Access Control Policy (RBAC/ABAC implementation priorities)
- Incident Response Policy (threat-informed response procedures)
- Business Continuity Plan (risk-based recovery prioritization)

## Review Cycle

Risk assessments are reviewed **quarterly** and updated following significant changes to the threat landscape, organizational structure, or IT infrastructure.
