# Risk Assessments

Risk assessment documentation for Emyzer Technology, developed using ServiceNow GRC.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [risk-assessment-methodology.md](risk-assessment-methodology.md) | Defines how risks are identified, analyzed, scored, and treated across the organization |
| [asset-risk-register.md](asset-risk-register.md) | Operational register with 15 documented risks across critical, high, medium, and low levels |

## What These Documents Demonstrate

**Risk Assessment Methodology**
- Structured six-step assessment process from identification through monitoring
- Qualitative scoring framework with 5x5 risk matrix
- Clear roles, responsibilities, and governance structure
- Framework alignment with NIST SP 800-30, ISO 27005, and COBIT

**Asset Risk Register**
- Executive summary with risk trends and decisions requiring attention
- Realistic risk entries showing the full lifecycle: newly identified, in treatment, monitoring, and formally accepted
- Treatment progress with specific details (vendor names, budget figures, completion percentages)
- Multiple risk categories: information security, privacy, operational, and third-party

## Framework Alignment

| Framework | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| NIST SP 800-30 | Risk assessment process and scoring criteria |
| NIST SP 800-37 | Risk Management Framework integration |
| ISO 27005 | Information security risk management principles |
| NIST CSF | ID.RA and ID.RM function alignment |

## How These Documents Work Together

The methodology defines the process. The register applies it.

The register references the methodology for scoring criteria rather than duplicating them. Risk entries use the exact field structure defined in the methodology. This demonstrates understanding of how GRC documentation should interconnect in an enterprise environment.
