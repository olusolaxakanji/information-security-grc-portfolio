# ServiceNow Evidence Exports

**Raw policy documentation extracted directly from ServiceNow GRC**

---

## What This Directory Contains

Every PDF in this folder represents a verifiable artifact—a policy document exported from ServiceNow's Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) module. These aren't templates. They're operational records that demonstrate how enterprise security governance operates within a structured platform.

The exports capture:

- **Policy metadata**: ownership, approval workflows, validity periods
- **Framework alignment**: COBIT, RBAC, ABAC, and other control references
- **Compliance mapping**: how each policy connects to organizational controls
- **Approval chains**: documented sign-offs with timestamps and approver comments

## Why Raw Exports Matter

Polished summaries tell a story. Raw exports prove it.

Auditors, hiring managers, and compliance reviewers need to see the underlying machinery. These PDFs show exactly what ServiceNow generates when you configure policies correctly—complete with system-generated timestamps, approval metadata, and relationship mappings.

This is the evidence layer beneath the narrative.

## Reading These Documents

ServiceNow exports follow a predictable structure:

1. **Header block**: Report metadata (run date, administrator, table name)
2. **Policy details**: Name, type, ownership, compliance score, parent policy
3. **Policy text**: The actual governance language—purpose, scope, definitions, procedures
4. **Approval records**: Who approved, when, and their comments
5. **Related lists**: Connected controls, evidence requirements, document versions

The formatting reflects ServiceNow's native output. No cleanup has been applied—these are the raw artifacts generated by the platform.

## Connecting Evidence to Policy

Each export in this directory corresponds to a structured policy document in the parent repository:

```
/access-control/access-control-policy.md  →  /servicenow-evidence/Access_Control_Policy.pdf
```

The markdown files present the policy content in a readable format. The PDF exports demonstrate that the policy exists within an enterprise GRC system with appropriate governance controls.

## For Reviewers

If you're evaluating this portfolio for GRC competency, these exports demonstrate:

- **Platform proficiency**: Ability to configure and manage policies within ServiceNow GRC
- **Governance rigor**: Understanding of approval workflows, ownership structures, and policy lifecycle management
- **Framework alignment**: Practical application of COBIT, RBAC, ABAC, and related control frameworks
- **Documentation discipline**: Maintaining traceable evidence that connects policy intent to operational controls

The exports aren't the deliverables. The organizational capability they represent is.
