# ServiceNow Evidence Exports

**Raw policy documentation extracted directly from ServiceNow GRC**

---

## What This Directory Contains

Every PDF in this folder represents a verifiable artifact—a policy document exported from ServiceNow's Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) module. These aren't templates. They're operational records that demonstrate how enterprise security governance operates within a structured platform.

The exports capture:

- **Policy metadata**: ownership, approval workflows, validity periods
- **Framework alignment**: COBIT, RBAC, ABAC, ISO 22301, and other control references
- **Compliance mapping**: how each policy connects to organizational controls
- **Approval chains**: documented sign-offs with timestamps and approver comments

---

## Why Raw Exports Matter

Polished summaries tell a story. Raw exports prove it.

Auditors, hiring managers, and compliance reviewers need to see the underlying machinery. These PDFs show exactly what ServiceNow generates when you configure policies correctly—complete with system-generated timestamps, approval metadata, and relationship mappings.

This is the evidence layer beneath the narrative.

## Reading These Documents

ServiceNow exports follow a predictable structure:

1. **Header block**: Report metadata (run date, administrator, table name)
2. **Policy details**: Name, type, ownership, compliance score, parent policy
3. **Policy text**: The actual governance language—purpose, scope, definitions, procedures
4. **Approval records**: Who approved, when, and their comments
5. **Related lists**: Connected controls, evidence requirements, document versions

The formatting reflects ServiceNow's native output. No cleanup has been applied—these are the raw artifacts generated by the platform.

## Policy Hierarchy

```
Information Security Policy (Parent)
├── Access Control Policy
├── Incident Management Policy
├── Risk Management Policy
└── Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy
```

The Information Security Policy serves as the parent document. All other policies inherit from and reference this foundational governance framework.

## Connecting Evidence to Policy

Each export in this directory corresponds to a structured policy document in the parent repository:

| Evidence File | Readable Policy |
|---------------|-----------------|
| [Access Control Policy.pdf](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/servicenow-evidence/Access%20Control%20Policy.pdf) | [access-control-policy.md](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/access-control-policy.md) |
| [Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy.pdf](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/servicenow-evidence/Business%20Continuity%20and%20Disaster%20Recovery%20Policy.pdf) | [bcdr-policy.md](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/bcdr-policy.md) |
| [Incident Management Policy.pdf](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/servicenow-evidence/Incident%20Management%20Policy.pdf) | [incident-management-policy.md](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/incident-management-policy.md) |
| [Information Security Policy.pdf](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/servicenow-evidence/Information%20Security%20Policy.pdf) | [information-security-policy.md](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/information-security-policy.md) |
| [Risk Management Policy.pdf](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/servicenow-evidence/Risk%20Management%20Policy.pdf) | [risk-management-policy.md](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/risk-management-policy.md) |

The markdown files present policy content in a readable format. The PDF exports prove that the policies exist within an enterprise GRC system with proper governance controls.

## For Reviewers

If you're evaluating this portfolio for GRC competency, these exports demonstrate:

- **Platform proficiency**: Ability to configure and manage policies within ServiceNow GRC
- **Governance rigor**: Understanding of approval workflows, ownership structures, and policy lifecycle management
- **Framework alignment**: Practical application of NIST, ISO 27001, ISO 22301, COBIT, and related control frameworks
- **Policy architecture**: Hierarchical policy design with clear parent-child relationships
- **Documentation discipline**: Maintaining traceable evidence that connects policy intent to operational controls

The exports aren't the deliverables. The organizational capability they represent is.

## Planned Development

The following policies are currently in development and will be added to this evidence repository upon completion:

| Planned Policy | Domain | Status |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Change Management & Configuration Policy | IT Operations | In Development |
| Acceptable Use Policy | User Governance | In Development |
| Data Classification Policy | Data Protection | In Development |
| Third-Party/Vendor Risk Management Policy | Supply Chain Security | In Development |
| Security Awareness & Training Policy | Human Risk Management | In Development |

These additions will expand the portfolio to 10 policies—a comprehensive governance framework covering access control, incident response, risk management, business continuity, IT operations, data protection, and human factors.
