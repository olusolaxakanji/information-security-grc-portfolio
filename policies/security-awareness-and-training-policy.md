## A. Purpose

To establish a comprehensive security awareness and training program that educates all workforce members about information security threats, policies, and best practices. This policy ensures that employees understand their security responsibilities, can recognize and respond to threats appropriately, and contribute to a security-conscious organizational culture. Effective security awareness reduces the risk of successful social engineering attacks, data breaches, and policy violations by transforming employees from potential vulnerabilities into active defenders.

## B. Scope

This policy applies to all individuals who access Emyzer Technology information systems, data, or facilities:

- Full-time and part-time employees
- Contractors and consultants
- Temporary staff and interns
- Third-party personnel with system access
- Executive leadership and board members

**Training categories covered:**

- New hire security orientation
- Annual security awareness refresher training
- Role-based specialized training
- Executive and board security briefings
- Phishing and social engineering simulations
- Ongoing security communications and alerts
- Incident-triggered remedial training

**Exclusions:** Third parties who access only public information or facilities without system access may be excluded from full training requirements at the discretion of the ISO, provided they receive basic security orientation.

---

## C. Definitions

1. **Security Awareness:** The knowledge and attitude members of an organization possess regarding the protection of information assets and the recognition of security threats.

2. **Security Training:** Formal instruction designed to build specific security knowledge and skills required for job functions.

3. **Phishing Simulation:** A controlled exercise that sends simulated phishing emails to employees to assess susceptibility and reinforce awareness.

4. **Social Engineering:** Psychological manipulation techniques used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

5. **Role-Based Training:** Specialized training tailored to the security responsibilities and risks associated with specific job functions.

6. **Learning Management System (LMS):** A software platform used to deliver, track, and report on training activities and completion.

7. **Remedial Training:** Additional training is assigned to individuals who fail assessments, fall victim to simulated attacks, or violate security policies.

8. **Security Champion:** An employee who serves as a departmental liaison for security awareness, promoting best practices and reporting concerns.

---

## D. Policy Statement

Emyzer Technology recognizes that employees are both a critical defense against cyber threats and a potential vulnerability if inadequately trained. To build a security-aware workforce, the organization shall:

1. Require all workforce members to complete security awareness training **within 30 days** of hire and **annually** thereafter.

2. Provide role-based training to employees in specialized positions **within 60 days** of role assignment.

3. Conduct phishing simulations **monthly** to assess and reinforce employee vigilance against social engineering.

4. Require employees who fail phishing simulations or assessments to complete remedial training **within 14 days**.

5. Maintain training completion rates of **95% or higher** across the organization.

6. Update training content **at least annually** to address emerging threats, new technologies, and lessons learned from incidents.

7. Measure training effectiveness through assessments, simulation results, and incident metrics.

8. Communicate security topics regularly through multiple channels to reinforce awareness between formal training sessions.

9. Provide executive leadership with security briefings **quarterly** on threat landscape and organizational risk posture.

10. Review and update this policy **annually** to ensure alignment with evolving threats and regulatory requirements.
