**NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**
- PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited
- PR.AC-3: Remote access is managed
- PR.AC-4: Access permissions and authorizations are managed
- PR.AC-6: Identities are proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions

**ISO/IEC 27001:2022:**
- A.5.15: Access control
- A.5.16: Identity management
- A.5.17: Authentication information
- A.5.18: Access rights
