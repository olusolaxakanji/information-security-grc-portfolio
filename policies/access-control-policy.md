# Access Control Policy

**Emyzer Technology**

> Every piece of information in our systems has value. This policy ensures that **the right people access the right information at the right time**. No one else.

---

## Who This Applies To

Everyone who touches our systems:

- Employees (all departments, all levels)
- Contractors and vendors
- Any authorized user with system credentials

If you log in, this policy governs what you can see and do.

---

## The Two Principles That Drive Every Decision

### 1. Least Privilege

You get access to what you need for your job. Nothing more. This isn't about distrust; it's about reducing exposure. Fewer access points mean fewer vulnerabilities.

### 2. Need-to-Know

Even if your role *could* justify access, you only receive it when there's an active, legitimate reason. Access isn't a status symbol; it's a responsibility.

---

## How Access Gets Assigned

We use two complementary systems:

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Your job title and function determine your baseline access. A finance analyst sees financial systems. A marketing coordinator sees campaign tools. The role defines the permissions.

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Context matters. ABAC layers additional factors onto role-based access: *where* you're logging in from, *what device* you're using, *what time* it is, *what specific resource* you're requesting. This creates dynamic, situation-aware security.

> **Think of RBAC as your key to a building. ABAC determines which doors inside that building open for you, based on current conditions.**

## Authentication: Proving You Are Who You Claim

Before accessing any system, you must verify your identity through secure authentication, including multi-factor authentication (MFA). This means something you *know* (password), something you *have* (phone, security key), or something you *are* (biometric).

One factor isn't enough. Layers matter.

---

## Ongoing Accountability

### Quarterly Access Reviews

Every three months, we audit who has access to what. Roles change. Projects end. People transfer. Access that made sense six months ago may be unnecessary today. Or risky.

### Annual Compliance Audits

Once per year, the IT Security Team conducts a comprehensive review to verify we're meeting both internal standards and external regulatory requirements.

### Continuous Monitoring

All access activity is logged. These logs aren't collected and forgotten; they're actively monitored for anomalies, unauthorized attempts, and patterns that suggest compromise.

---

## When Access Ends

**Immediate Revocation Triggers:**

- Employment termination
- Contract completion
- Role change that eliminates the need

There is no grace period for unnecessary access. When your need ends, your access ends. Same day.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **IT Security Team** | Implements access controls, conducts reviews, monitors logs, enforces compliance |
| **Department Managers** | Defines role requirements, approves access requests for their teams |
| **Every User** | Protects credentials, follows policy, reports suspicious activity immediately |

---

## How to Request Access

1. Submit an access request form to the IT Security Team
2. Your department manager reviews and approves (or denies) based on role requirements
3. IT Security configures your access according to the approved request

No shortcuts. No informal arrangements. The paper trail protects everyone.

---

## Consequences of Violation

Policy violations aren't treated as administrative inconveniences. Depending on severity, consequences range from formal documentation to termination of employment or contract.

This isn't punitive for its own sake. Unauthorized access, whether intentional or careless, puts data, people, and the organization at risk.

---

## Organizational Benefits

- Ensures only authorized personnel access sensitive information
- Reduces risk of unauthorized access and data breaches
- Supports regulatory and framework compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, COBIT)
- Creates clear accountability through documented access decisions
- Enables faster incident response through access logging

---

## Evidence of Compliance

- Access request forms with manager approval signatures
- Quarterly access review reports
- Annual compliance audit documentation
- Access logs and monitoring reports
- User authentication records (MFA enrollment)
- Access revocation records tied to termination dates
