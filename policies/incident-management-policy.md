## E. Roles and Responsibilities

### Information Security Officer (ISO)
- Oversee the incident management process
- Ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations
- Report significant incidents to executive management

### Incident Response Team (IRT)
- Manage detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery of incidents
- Coordinate response activities across departments
- Maintain incident documentation and evidence

### Department Heads
- Ensure teams comply with the incident management policy
- Support incident response activities within their areas of responsibility
- Participate in post-incident reviews

### All Employees
- Report any suspected or actual information security incidents immediately to the ISO or IRT
- Preserve evidence and avoid actions that could worsen the incident
- Cooperate fully with incident response activities

---

## F. Procedures

### F.1 Incident Identification and Reporting
All employees must report suspected incidents to the IRT immediately through established reporting channels. The IRT logs the incident in the incident management system with initial classification and severity assessment.

### F.2 Incident Analysis
The IRT conducts a preliminary analysis to determine the scope, impact, and classification of the incident. If personal data is involved, GDPR breach notification procedures are initiated immediately.

### F.3 Incident Classification
Incidents are classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

### F.4 Containment
The IRT implements immediate measures to contain the incident and prevent further damage. Containment strategies vary based on incident type and severity.

### F.5 Eradication
The IRT identifies and removes the root cause of the incident. This may include patching vulnerabilities, removing malware, or closing unauthorized access points.

### F.6 Recovery
The IRT restores affected systems and services to normal operation. Recovery procedures include verification of system integrity and monitoring for recurrence.

### F.7 Post-Incident Review
A structured post-incident review is conducted to identify lessons learned, update procedures, and improve future incident response efforts. Findings are documented and shared with relevant stakeholders.

---

## G. Compliance and Monitoring

### Internal Audits
The Information Security Officer monitors compliance with this policy through regular audits and incident reviews. Audit findings are reported to executive management.

### Performance Metrics
Key performance indicators (KPIs) track incident response effectiveness, including:
- Time to detect incidents
- Time to contain incidents
- Time to recover from incidents
- Number of incidents by category and severity

### Enforcement
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment or contract.
