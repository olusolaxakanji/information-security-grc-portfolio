| **COSO ERM** | A framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks across an enterprise to support strategic objectives. |
| **CIS RAM** | A methodology for assessing and managing information security risks using standardized assessment techniques. |
| **Risk Assessment** | The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood. |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Actions taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk to acceptable levels. |
| **Risk Appetite** | The amount and type of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. |
| **Risk Tolerance** | The specific maximum risk an organization is willing to take regarding specific objectives. |
| **Inherent Risk** | The level of risk before controls are applied. |

- Participate in risk management activities as required
- Support risk mitigation efforts within their roles

---

## F. Procedures

### F.1 Risk Identification
Risks are identified using multiple sources including risk assessments, internal audits, incident reports, employee feedback, industry threat intelligence, and regulatory changes. Risk identification is conducted continuously and formally reviewed quarterly.

### F.2 Risk Assessment
Identified risks are assessed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Assessment considers likelihood of occurrence, potential impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability, regulatory and compliance implications, and alignment with organizational risk appetite.

### F.3 Risk Analysis
Risks are analyzed to determine inherent risk level (before controls), existing control effectiveness, and residual risk level (after controls). Analysis includes evaluation of interdependencies between risks and cumulative risk exposure.

### F.4 Risk Evaluation
Risks are evaluated against established risk criteria and prioritized based on severity. Risk owners are assigned, and treatment decisions are made (accept, mitigate, transfer, or avoid).

### F.5 Risk Mitigation
Risk mitigation plans are developed and implemented to reduce likelihood or impact of risks to acceptable levels. Plans include specific actions, timelines, resource requirements, and success metrics.

### F.6 Risk Monitoring
Risks and the effectiveness of mitigation measures are continuously monitored. Key risk indicators (KRIs) track changes in risk exposure. Monitoring results inform adjustments to mitigation plans as necessary.

### F.7 Risk Reporting
Regular reports on risk status and mitigation efforts are provided to senior management and the Risk Management Committee. Reporting includes risk register updates, emerging risk trends, mitigation plan progress, and recommendations for risk treatment.

---

## G. Compliance and Monitoring

### Internal Audits
Compliance with this policy is monitored through regular internal audits conducted by the Internal Audit function. Audit findings are reported to the Risk Management Committee.

### Performance Metrics
Key performance indicators (KPIs) track risk management effectiveness, including:
- Number of risks identified and assessed
- Percentage of risks with assigned owners and mitigation plans
- Time to implement risk mitigation measures
- Reduction in residual risk over time
- Compliance with risk assessment schedule

### Enforcement
Non-compliance with this policy will be addressed through corrective actions and, if necessary, disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment or contract.
