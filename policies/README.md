## Policy Development Methodology

All policies follow a consistent structure aligned with GRC best practices:

**1. Document Control**
- Clear ownership, versioning, and review schedules
- Classification and parent policy hierarchy

**2. Purpose and Scope**
- Explicit statement of policy intent and applicability
- Boundaries clearly defined

**3. Policy Statement**
- Core requirements and standards
- Specific, measurable, and enforceable provisions

**4. Roles and Responsibilities**
- Clear accountability assignments
- Separation of duties where appropriate

**5. Procedures**
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Operational workflows and decision points

**6. Compliance and Enforcement**
- Monitoring mechanisms and audit requirements
- Consequences for non-compliance

**7. Framework Alignment**
- Explicit mapping to recognized security standards
- Control objective traceability

**8. Organizational Benefits**
- Business value articulation
- Risk reduction and efficiency gains

**9. Evidence of Compliance**
- Audit trail requirements
- Documentation and reporting cadence

## Policy Maintenance

**Review Cycle:** All policies are reviewed annually or when significant organizational changes occur.

**Update Process:** Policy updates follow formal change management with:
1. Risk assessment of proposed changes
2. Stakeholder review and feedback
3. Approval by policy owner and Risk Management Committee
4. Communication to affected parties
5. Training updates as needed

**Version Control:** Each policy maintains a document history table tracking all revisions.
