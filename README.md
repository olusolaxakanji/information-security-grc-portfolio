**ServiceNow GRC Project – Emyzer Technology (Fictionalized Case Study)**  
*A living GRC portfolio of production-style security policies, evidence mapping, and governance workflows.*

## Start Here (60-Second Review Path)

If you only have a minute, start with the **Information Security Policy** and review in this order:

1. **Policy Snapshot** → executive view (scope, governance, exceptions, evidence)  
2. **Evidence Index** → audit readiness view (system of record, owner, retention)  
3. **Policy Exceptions** → real-world governance (approval, duration, quarterly review)

✅ **Flagship Artifact:** [Information Security Policy](https://github.com/olusolaxakanji/information-security-grc-portfolio/blob/main/policies/information-security-policy.md)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates hands-on GRC work implemented in ServiceNow GRC and translated into clear, audit-oriented documentation. It includes enforceable policy language, defined governance roles, exception handling, evidence-of-compliance artifacts, and framework alignment.

**Note on maturity:** This portfolio is actively maintained. One policy is **flagship-ready**, while the remaining completed policies are undergoing **quality upgrades** (consistency, evidence indexing, governance clarity, and control cadence).

---

## Organizational Context (Fictionalized Case Study)

Emyzer Technology is a fictional multinational technology company operating across Asia, the Americas, Africa, and parts of Europe and the Middle East. The organization provides:

- Laptop production and global distribution  
- Cloud service management  
- Enterprise technical support  
- Global security implementation for businesses  

The organization employs over **5,000 staff worldwide** and operates in a complex, distributed IT and security environment that requires structured governance and resilience planning.

*This case study was designed to simulate realistic enterprise conditions for practicing GRC methodology, framework application, and ServiceNow platform workflows.*

---

## Project Scope & Objectives

This project was completed using **ServiceNow** and focused on:

1. Development of **10+ applicable information security policies** aligned to recognized frameworks  
2. Documentation of **organizational benefits** for each policy  
3. Identification of **evidence of compliance** and retention expectations  
4. Design of a **Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)** aligned to **ISO/IEC 22301**  
5. Translation of ServiceNow-generated policies into documentation suitable for audit review and public portfolio demonstration  

All policies, procedures, and plans were created and managed within the **ServiceNow platform** in accordance with project requirements.
