**ServiceNow GRC Project – Emyzer Technology (Case Study)**

---

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates an actively evolving repository of hands-on GRC experience, with production-quality artifacts covering policy development, framework alignment (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2, COBIT), risk management, and enterprise security planning.

---

## Organizational Context (Case Study)

Emyzer Technology is a multinational technology company operating across Asia, America, Africa, and parts of Europe and the Middle East. The organization provides:

- Laptop production and global distribution
- Cloud service management
- Enterprise technical support
- Global security implementation for businesses

The organization employs over **5,000 staff worldwide** and operates within a complex, distributed IT and security environment requiring structured governance and resilience planning.

---

## Project Scope & Objectives

This project was completed using **ServiceNow** and focused on the following objectives:

1. Development of **10+ applicable information security policies** aligned to a recognized security framework
2. Documentation of **organizational benefits** for each policy
3. Identification of **evidence of compliance** for each policy
4. Design of a **Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)** aligned with **ISO/IEC 22301**
5. Translation of ServiceNow-generated policies into structured documentation suitable for audit, governance review, and portfolio demonstration

All policies, procedures, and plans were created and managed within the **ServiceNow platform** as required by the project brief.
